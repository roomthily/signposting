# Scenarios

This page is a set of linking scenarios for [signposting the scholarly web](README.md).

## Generic DOI for journal article with PDF and HTML

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="journal_with_pdf_html.svg">Your browser does not support SVG</object>

## DLib article example, no splash page

[DLib](http://dlib.org/) is unusual in that articles are HTML and there is no separate splash or landing page.

## PLOS article example with separately identifier figure

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="plos_with_component_image.svg">Your browser does not support SVG</object>

## arXiv without an abstract article item (as at present)

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="arxiv_no_item.svg">Your browser does not support SVG</object>

## arXiv with an abstract article item (planned)

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="arxiv_plan.svg">Your browser does not support SVG</object>

## DOI resolution to multiple sources

In some case a DOI resolves to an HTML choice page instead of to the splash page on a single publishers' website. When the user chooses which publisher to go to, they get to a splash page as usual.
